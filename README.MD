##### This is a repo set up to follow along with Drew Conley's [Let's Build an RPG with JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyi4vfbKEeo&list=PLcjhmZ8oLT0r9dSiIK6RB_PuBWlG1KSq_&index=1) tutorial.

# Part 1: [Let's Build an RPG with JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyi4vfbKEeo)

We were able to draw something to the screen, scale it up, and place an object in a different position (_after_ aligning the spritesheet, of course).

TIL about self-executing functions:

```js
(function () {
  console.log("This looks odd, right?!");
})();
```

> _Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)_
> **_An IIFE is a function that runs as soon as it is defined. It is "immediate" because it executes right away, and it is "invoked" because it is called. This pattern is useful for creating a new scope, avoiding global namespace pollution, and encapsulating logic that should not be exposed outside of the current execution context._**

# Part 2: [Adding Game Objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpbghr3NnUU)

Today we refactored the code and created 2 more component(ish) files. I had a bit of an issue with where the characters were positoned, but I was able to resolve it by fixing a typo.

Looking forward to Part 3!
