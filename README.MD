# Part 1: [Let's Build an RPG with JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyi4vfbKEeo&list=PLcjhmZ8oLT0r9dSiIK6RB_PuBWlG1KSq_&index=2)

We were able to draw something to the screen, scale it up, and place an object in a different position (*after* aligning the spritesheet, of course).

TIL about self-executing functions:
```js
(function () {
    console.log("This looks odd, right?!")
})();
```

> *Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)*
***An IIFE is a function that runs as soon as it is defined. It is "immediate" because it executes right away, and it is "invoked" because it is called. This pattern is useful for creating a new scope, avoiding global namespace pollution, and encapsulating logic that should not be exposed outside of the current execution context.***
